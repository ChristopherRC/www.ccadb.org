## Incident Reporting

**Note:** The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" on this page are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

### Why is public Incident Reporting considered important?
The public Incident Reporting process is important because it promotes continuous improvement, information sharing, and highlights opportunities to define and adopt improved practices, policies, and controls. Together, these activities help build a more secure web.

### Who can submit an Incident Report?
Anyone should feel encouraged to submit an Incident Report that’s founded upon credible and well-substantiated evidence.

Some Root Store Operator policies require CA Owners to submit an Incident Report as described on this page after self-discovering or being made aware of an Incident (e.g., receiving and corroborating an issue described in a [Certificate Problem Report](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#161-definitions)).

### Are there other ways to become involved in the Incident Reporting process?
Absolutely! There are many ways to participate in the Incident Reporting process beyond submitting new reports. Everyone is encouraged to actively contribute by commenting on existing reports and engaging in constructive discussions. This can include, but is not limited to:

- Providing additional information,
- Asking clarifying questions,
- Discussing technical aspects of the incident,
- Suggesting corrective actions,
- Highlighting opportunities for improvement,
- Contributing lints to open source linting projects to promote improved future issue detection/prevention, and
- Sharing lessons learned from past experiences.

Individuals representing CA Owners are especially encouraged to participate broadly in the Incident Reporting process, extending their contributions beyond incidents involving only their own organization. Sharing insights and perspectives across organizational boundaries fosters a collaborative learning environment and strengthens the overall security posture of the Web PKI ecosystem.

To ensure productive dialogue, please keep all comments constructive, relevant to the report, and in line with the [CCADB Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ALqEvHtTE6OUTz2FaOXrU9gruIdvia5EDh3hXeGpZA/edit#heading=h.cumc0pgd1s7c).

### How do I submit an Incident Report?
Create a new Bugzilla issue by filling out the Summary and Description fields of [this form](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=__default__&product=CA%20Program&component=CA%20Certificate%20Compliance&bug_type=task). 

The "Summary" field in Bugzilla (i.e., "Subject line") MUST begin with the CA Owner’s name, followed by a colon, and a brief title that highlights the type of incident being reported (e.g., "EXAMPLE CA OWNER: Incorrect Subject RDN Encoding"). 

The "Description" field MAY contain a Preliminary or Full Incident Report (copied and pasted from the corresponding markdown template, as explained [below](#incident-report-templates)). 

### What format should be used?
Use one of the templates below, depending on the type of Incident Report being disclosed:

- [Preliminary Incident Report](#preliminary-incident-report) (for third party reporters and CA Owners)
- [Full Incident Report](#full-incident-report) (for CA Owners)

If being reported by the CA Owner corresponding with an incident, all fields included in the relevant template MUST be completed.

### When are Incident Reports expected?

Within 72 hours of the CA Owner being made aware of an incident (i.e., “initial incident disclosure”), it MUST 

Either:
1) disclose a Preliminary or Full Incident Report; or
2) respond to a Preliminary Incident Report previously created for the incident by a third party reporter.

And:
- accurately and completely disclose the impact of the incident (e.g., a corpus of mis-issued certificates).
- describe whether the incident should be considered contained (e.g., because certificate issuance was stopped) or ongoing.

If the described impact of the incident is later found to be inaccurate, the CA Owner MUST clearly communicate a correction, identifying when each following change was detected, the circumstances that led to the inaccuracy, and how this will be avoided in the future.

While Full Incident Reports SHOULD be posted as soon as possible, they MUST be posted within 14 days of the incident’s initial disclosure.

### What is considered an incident?

Minimally, a failure to meet the commitments described in any of the following policies is considered an incident:
- A CA Owner's own policies (e.g., CP, CPS, or combined CP/CPS);
- The corresponding set of CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements;
- The CCADB Policy; or
- Any applicable Root Store Operator policy.

Root Store Operator policies MAY further describe what those individual programs consider incidents, and/or additional incident reporting expectations.

### When should Incident Reports be updated?

CA Owners SHOULD respond promptly to comments and questions, and in no circumstances MUST a request or question linger without a response for more than 7 days, even if the response is only to acknowledge the request or question and provide a later date when a response will be delivered. Comments from the community SHOULD be acknowledged and addressed by CA Owners.

Open Incident Reports MUST be updated:
- on or before the “Next update” date in the “Whiteboard” field of the bug (note: CA Owners MAY request the "Next update" Whiteboard field be set by a Root Store Operator to align with a specific date related to an open Action Item.);
- weekly, if a “Next update” date is not recorded;
- in response to community questions or comments as described above; or
- when Action Items are changed, completed, or delayed.

In the case of Incident Reports with a Whiteboard field of "revocation-delay", Incident Reports MUST be updated every 72 hours to describe a summary of: 
- the number of certificates that have been revoked.
- the number of certificates that have NOT YET been revoked.
- the number of certificates planned for revocation that have expired.

### How should Incident Reports be scoped?

There SHOULD be a single Incident Report for each distinct matter, and CA Owners MUST submit an additional, separate Incident Report when:
- policy requires the revocation of one or more certificates by a certain deadline, such as those in BR Section 4.9, but that deadline will not be or has not been met by the CA Owner (i.e., a delayed revocation Incident Report).
- in the process of researching one incident, another incident with a distinct root cause and/or remediation is discovered.
- after an incident is marked resolved in Bugzilla, the incident reoccurs.

Incident Reports MUST be free-standing (i.e., not rely upon the contents of other reports). The Incident Report MAY repeat things previously stated in discussions or Bugzilla comments, in which case the report SHOULD state a summary of previous findings. The existence of data in discussions or Bugzilla comments does not excuse a CA Owner from the task of compiling an Incident Report that aligns with the guidance on this page.

### What are the key characteristics of an incident report?

Incident Reports MUST include:
- a demonstration of understanding of the root cause(s) of an incident, and
- a substantive commitment and timeline to changes that clearly and persuasively address the root cause.

### What should Root Cause Analysis consider?

Effective Root Cause Analysis (RCA) considers the following points:

1. **Focus on the "why," not just the "what"**. RCA shouldn't just identify what went wrong but should delve deeper into why it happened. This often involves going beyond the immediate technical or policy failure and considering contributing factors like human error, process deficiencies, or system design flaws.

2. **Use a systematic approach**. Employ structured methodologies like the following approaches to help ensure a thorough and organized investigation:
   - [Chesterton’s Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/)
   - [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)
   - Multi/Second Order Thinking ([1](https://fs.blog/second-order-thinking/), [2](https://betterletter.substack.com/p/second-order-thinking), [3](https://medium.com/@noahmp/second-order-thinking-3fc2a224b131))
   - [CATWOE](https://www.toolshero.com/problem-solving/catwoe-analysis/)
   - [Cause and Effect / Fishbone or Ishikawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawa_diagram)
   - [Drilling Down](https://sigma.software/about/media/problem-solving-techniques-part-two#2.-drill-down)
   - SRE Handbook Guidance
       - [Chapter 14](https://sre.google/sre-book/managing-incidents/)
       - [Chapter 15](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/)

4. **Consider all potential contributing factors**. RCA should consider a broad range of potential causes, including technical issues, policy issues, human factors, process breakdowns, and external influences. It's crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions or focusing solely on the most obvious cause(s).

5. **Collect and analyze data**. Data is critical for supporting RCA conclusions. This might involve reviewing logs, monitoring metrics, internal incident reports, and other relevant information to identify patterns and anomalies.

6. **Involve relevant stakeholders**. RCA should be a collaborative effort involving engineers, operators, support teams, and other relevant stakeholders. This helps ensure a diverse range of perspectives and expertise is considered.

7. **Prioritize action items**. The ultimate goal of RCA is to prevent future incidents caused by the same failures. Therefore, it's important to identify and prioritize actionable recommendations that address the root causes identified.

8. **Focus on blameless postmortems**. Emphasize a blameless culture when conducting postmortems. The focus should be on learning from the incident and improving systems, not on assigning blame or punishing individuals.

9. **Continuously improve the process**. RCA is an iterative process. Organizations should continuously refine their RCA approaches based on lessons learned from previous incidents and evolving best practices.

### What is considered an ongoing commitment? 
An ongoing commitment is a formal pledge made by a CA Owner to address underlying issues and improve practices in response to an incident. These commitments extend beyond immediate incident remediation and demonstrate a sustained effort to enhance security, transparency, and/or accountability within the Web PKI ecosystem.

Effective ongoing commitments considers the following points:

1. **Specificity**. The commitment clearly outlines what the CA Owner will do, including the intended outcome, target completion timeframe, and any relevant metrics or indicators.
 
2. **Actionability**: The commitment describes concrete steps the CA Owner will take, ensuring it's not merely a statement of intent or a vague promise.
 
3. **Measurability**: The commitment includes a way to track progress and assess whether the CA has fulfilled its pledge. This could involve public reporting, audits, or other verifiable means.
 
4. **Relevance**: The commitment directly relates to the incident report's findings and addresses the identified issues or concerns.
 
5. **Impact**: The commitment aims to bring about positive change and improve the Web PKI ecosystem, either by preventing similar incidents or mitigating their potential impact.

While both action items and ongoing commitments contribute to addressing the root cause(s), they are intended to serve distinct purposes and have unique characteristics:


| Characteristic        | Action Item                    | Ongoing Commitment                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective**         | Resolve the immediate incident | Prevent future incidents and improve practices |
| **Scope**             | Narrow, specific tasks         | Broad, strategic initiatives                   |
| **Timeframe**         | Short-term, with a deadline    | Long-term, continuous effort                   |
| **Example**           | “We will revoke all mis-issued certificates within the next 48 hours. By that time, all revoked certificates will appear on the CRL located at $location.” <br><br> “We will implement Version 1.0 of pkimetal in our production environment for pre-issuance linting by $date.”  | “To reduce the likelihood of certificate mis-issuance, we will perform pre-issuance linting using pkimetal with the auto-detect profile set for all certificates issued after $date.  <br><br> Any error returned by pkimetal will result in blocking issuance and will necessitate manual review by at least two members of our compliance team.  <br><br> We will update pkimetal within 7 days after an updated release is made available.  <br><br> The presence of linting failures where certificates were issued more than 7 days after a new lint was released will represent a failure of this ongoing commitment.” |

### How should Incident Reports be closed?

If (1) all Action Items are marked as complete and (2) there are no outstanding comments or questions that need to be addressed, CA Owners MUST clearly communicate in a Bugzilla comment when they believe an Incident Report can be closed. This is accomplished by writing a short-summary that includes:
- a description of the incident, its root cause(s), and remediation.
- a summary of all ongoing commitments made in response to the incident.
- an attestation that all Action Items have been completed.

CA Owners MUST use the template below when providing an incident closure summary.

```markdown
### Incident Report Closure Summary
- **Incident Description**: [A few sentences summarizing the incident.]
- **Incident Root Cause(s)**: [A few sentences summarizing the root cause(s).]
- **Remediation Description** [A few sentences summarizing the incident's remediation.]
- **Commitment Summary**: [List ongoing commitments made in response to this incident.]

All Action Items disclosed in this Incident Report have been completed as described, and we request its closure.

```

Upon completing the above, a final call for comments will be made by a Bugzilla moderator, and the incident will be closed accordingly.

### Incident Report Templates

The templates below describe the expected contents of an Incident Report. When responding to an incident, the latest version of these templates MUST be relied upon.

#### Preliminary Incident Report

```markdown
## Preliminary Incident Report

### Summary
<!---

**Expectations:**

- This section SHOULD clearly address the following:
     - **Incident description**: [A short description of the nature of the issue. This provides just enough context for new readers to understand the details of the incident.]
     - **Relevant policies**: [Describe the policies and corresponding sections that result in this problem being diagnosed as an incident.]
 
- If the report was created by the corresponding CA Owner, this section MUST also answer the following question:
     - **When is the Full Incident Report expected by?**: [DATE within 2 weeks of the incident’s initial disclosure (i.e., either to the CA Owner, or Bugzilla)]

-->
```

#### Full Incident Report

```markdown
## Full Incident Report

     - **CA Owner CCADB Unique ID:** [The CCADB Unique ID value corresponding to the CA Owner's "CA Owner/Certificate" record disclosed in the CCADB.]
     - **Incident description**: [A short description of the nature of the issue. This provides just enough context for new readers to understand the details of the incident.]
     - **Timeline Summary:
          - Non-compliance Start Date: [When the non-compliance began.]
          - Non-compliance Identified Date: [When the non-compliance was detected.]
          - Non-compliance End Date: [When the non-compliance ended or is expected to end.]

     - **Source of incident disclosure**: [CHOICE of "Self Reported", "Third Party Reported", or "AUDIT".]

     NOTE: If notified of an incident by a Third Party Reporter, please respect their privacy by only disclosing their name if affirmatively approved to do so (i.e., use "We received a report from a community member." instead of explicitly naming individuals).
 
-->

### Impact
<!---

**Expectations:**

- The Impact Section MUST contain a description of the size and nature of the incident. For example: how many certificates, OCSP responses, or CRLs were affected; whether the affected objects share features (such as issuance time, signature algorithm, or validation type).
- If certificates are impacted, the Impact Section MUST address the following:
     - **Total number of certificates**: [if applicable, the total count of all certificates affected by the issue(s) described in this Incident Report, including expired and revoked certificates]
     - **Total number of "remaining valid" certificates**: [if applicable, the total count of certificates affected by the issue(s) described in this Incident Report, minus expired and revoked certificates. Minimally, this set of certificates MUST be disclosed in the Appendix section of this report.]
     - **Affected certificate types:** [A summary of the corresponding CA/Browser Forum policy OIDs (i.e., DV, IV, OV, and EV) that appear in the certificates affected by this incident (e.g., “This incident affects DV and OV certificates.”)]
     - **Incident heuristic:** [if applicable, EITHER:
          - (a) describe a heuristic that would allow a third party to assemble the full corpus of affected certificates, if not provided in the Appendix (e.g., "Any certificate containing policy OID 1.2.3.4.5.6 and issued between 11/13/2024 and 4/11/2024 is affected by this incident. Certificates that have been revoked or are expired are omitted from the certificate list disclosed in the Appendix."), 
          - (b) clearly explain why this isn't possible (e.g., "This incident affected every certificate issued between 5/25/2023 and 6/15/2024 that relied upon BR Validation Method 3.2.2.4.19. Because the relied upon validation method is not described in a certificate, this heuristic cannot be used by a third party to assemble the full corpus of affected certificates. Certificates that have been revoked or expired have been omitted from the certificate list disclosed in the Appendix.), or
          - (c) the full corpus of affected certificates are disclosed in the Appendix.]
     - **Was issuance stopped in response to this incident, and why or why not?:** [yes/no - explanation (e.g., "Yes. As described in the incident timeline, issuance was stopped after learning of this issue to correct the corresponding certificate profile.")]
     - **Additional Considerations:** [share any additional considerations that might be useful in describing the size and nature of the incident. For example, if the issue affected pre-certificates and "final" certificates differently, describe how and why in more detail here.]

-->

### Timeline
<!---

**Expectations:**

- The Timeline Section MUST include a detailed timeline of all events and actions leading up to and taken during and after the incident.
- The timeline MUST include not just the actual discovery of the incident and subsequent events, but also relevant events occurring beforehand (e.g., something changed or was introduced).
- All times MUST be in UTC OR UTC+local offset, and SHOULD have at least minute-level granularity.
- In addition, it MUST indicate the following events:
     - All policy, process, and software changes that contributed to the Root Cause(s)
     - The time at which the incident began
     - The time(s) at which the same failure mode was observed in other incidents disclosed in Bugzilla during the two years preceding this report
     - The time at which the CA Owner became aware of the incident
     - The time at which the CA Owner received a Certificate Problem Report (if applicable)
     - The time at which the CA Owner provided a preliminary report on its findings to the entity who filed the Certificate Problem Report (if applicable)
     - The time at which the CA Owner provided a preliminary report on its findings to the affected Subscriber(s) (if applicable)
     - The time at which the CA Owner concluded and disclosed the scope and impact of the incident
     - The time at which the CA Owner is expected to complete revocation of affected certificates (if applicable)
     - The time(s) at which the CA Owner actually completed revocation of affected certificates (if applicable) 
     - The time at which the incident ended
     - The times at which issuance ceased and resumed (if applicable)
-->

### Root Cause Analysis
<!---

**Expectations:**

- A root cause is defined as a factor that caused a nonconformance and SHOULD be permanently eliminated through process improvement.
- This section MUST contain a detailed analysis of the conditions which combined to give rise to the issue.
- It is unusual for an incident to have a single root cause; often there is a confluence of several issues such as a software bug, insufficient checks, and a malformed request.
- Make sure that all contributing causes are identified and described, including noting when they first arose and how they avoided detection until they were discovered or identified. 

#### Issue [#]: [Title]
- **Description:** [A detailed description of the specific issue.]
- **Issue Onset:** [Date when the issue began.]
- **Issue Detection:** [Date when the issue was detected or otherwise made known.]
- **Issue Resolution:** [Actual or planned date when the issue will be considered resolved.]
- **Symptoms that Led to Detection**: [A detailed description of the circumstances that led to the detection of the issue.]
- **How the Issue Avoided Detection**: [A detailed description of how the issue was not detected earlier.]
- **Root Cause Analysis Methodology Used**([OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED]): [A description of the methodology used to derive the issue described above (e.g., "5-Whys", Fishbone Diagram, Pareto Analysis, etc.)]

-->

### Lessons Learned
<!---

**Expectations:** This section MUST answer the following questions:
- **What went well:** [a list of things that caused the incident to have less impact than it otherwise could have, such as early detection, rapid response, or good safety mechanisms. This section provides an opportunity for others to learn from the good practices of this CA Owner.]
- **What didn’t go well:** [a list of things that caused the incident to have more impact than it otherwise would have, such as missing checks or unclear documentation. Each item here MUST have at least one corresponding Action Item below and SHOULD provide opportunities for others to ensure they make similar improvements if they haven’t already.]
- **Where we got lucky:** [a list of things that went well, but which cannot be relied upon, such as early detection by an external security researcher or limited impact simply due to a small number of requests. Items here SHOULD generally also have corresponding Action Items, so that the CA Owner doesn’t have to rely on luck in the future.]
- ** Other:** [anything else you’d like to share that’s not described above.]

-->

### Action Items
<!---

**Expectations:**

- This section MUST contain a list of remediation items that will be undertaken to ensure that similar incidents do not reoccur in the future.
- Note that it is not sufficient for these action items to simply stop this incident, they MUST create additional protections to prevent future incidents.
- Each Action Item MUST state:
     - **Action Item Description** [A detailed description of the action to be taken.]
     - **Kind** [A classification of whether the action will help Prevent future incidents, Mitigate the impact of future incidents, or Detect future incidents. CA Owners are encouraged to propose action items in all three categories, with an emphasis on Prevent and Mitigate.] 
     - **Corresponding Root Cause(s)** [The specific Root Cause that the Action intends to remediate (i.e., each issue entry in the "Root Cause Analysis" and "What didn't go well" Sections MUST be mapped to at least one specific action item)]
     - **Due Date** [A date by which the action item will be complete.]

| Action Item | Kind    | Corresponding Root Cause(s) | Due Date   |
| ----------- | ----    | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| Example     | Prevent | Root Cause # 1              | 2025-01-19 |

-->

### Appendix
<!---

**Expectations:**
- The Appendix is for all supporting data: log files, graphs and charts, etc.
- In particular, in the case of incidents that directly impact certificates, the Appendix MUST include a comma separated listing of certificate details of all affected certificates and include the following fields for each:
     - Pre-certificate SHA-256 Hash
     - Certificate SHA-256 Hash
     - Subject
     - Issuer
     - Not Before
     - Not After
     - Serial # (hex)
     - Is Revoked? ("Yes", "Planned”,"Delayed", or “N/A" (for expired))
     - Revocation Date (Actual Date, Planned Date, or "N/A")
     - Revocation Reason
- When the incident being reported involves an S/MIME certificate, if disclosure of personally identifiable information in the certificate MAY be contrary to applicable law, please provide at least the certificate serial number and SHA256 hash of the certificate.

-->

```

### Are there examples of “good" Incident Reports?

Here are some examples of good practice, where a CA Owner did most or all of the things recommended above:

- [Serving invalid or incomplete CRLs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1900129)
     - Clear Summary and Impact statements allow readers to quickly understand the scope of the incident
     - Detailed and thorough evaluation of existing safeguards that failed, allowing for an understanding of why the the incident was allowed to take place
     - Comments and questions from the community were responded to promptly.

- [keyCompromise key blocking deviation from CP/CPS](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1886876)
     - Clear indication of Preliminary and Full Incident Reports.
     - Detailed timeline that identifies all policy, process, and software changes that contributed to the root cause, and an indication of when the incident began and ended.
     - Detailed Root Cause Analysis that offers background on the various conditions that gave rise to the issue.
     - Timely updates in response to questions posed, continued analysis, and changes to Action Items.
 
- [Failure to properly validate IP address](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1876593)
     - Significant amount of background information that informs the timeline of the incident.
     - Clear identification of the contributing factors that contributed to the incident that notes how many of them avoided detection in the Root Cause Analysis.
     - Action Items that prevent, mitigate, and detect what didn’t go well.
     - Timely and detailed updates conveying Action Item status.
 
- [Anomaly in OCSP services after CA software upgrade](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1878106)
     - Clear Summary that provides just enough context for new readers to understand the rest of the report.
     - Effective use of the “5 Whys” Root Cause Analysis methodology where “why” is asked as many times as necessary to identify the root cause of the incident.
     - Action Items that prevent and detect what didn’t go well.
     - Timely updates in response to questions posed and changes to Action Items.
 
  Upon adoption of the updated Incident Report templates above, examples of good practice will be updated.
